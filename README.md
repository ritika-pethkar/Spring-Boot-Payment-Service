This mini project is a Spring Boot-based payment processing system that simulates an e-commerce checkout using dependency injection. It includes a FlipKart service that integrates with multiple payment partners (JusPay, Paytm, Razorpay) to process transactions. The project demonstrates Spring Boot concepts such as component scanning, dependency injection (@Autowired), interface-based service design, and externalized configuration (@Value).
